New Adventures

**[Live site]()**

------------------------------------------------------------------

**[Repository](https://github.com/Maddiesel90/MS1-New-Adventures)**
  



## UX

This website was to make users aware of adventure activities available. I first chose the background image to highlight the elements linked to the locations of the activities. From there I chose a colour palette that used examples from the image and kept along the theme of adventurous nature. Along with the primary colours of #047D8B and #56EAFA I chose a high contrasting #FF7C0A to use when I needed to catch the eye of the user. I then chose a light and dark color to help with contrast - #F1EDEE & #141B41. Once I had the colour scheme I picked a font that I believed would emanate someone writing whilst on an adventure. With this I chose a complementing font to use in the bigger chunks of text. 

Home

I wanted to keep the landing page simple so the consumer immediately noticed the call to action button mid screen. I kept the same heading on each page for a smooth less transition from one section to the next. 

About

I wanted the about page to give a little further information regarding who made the website and also to show it was open for a collaborative experience with them. I chose pictures depicting what the user should feel whilst doing the experiences and also focused on groups to highlight the shared experience.

Activities

My aim was for the activities page to be the main page of the website containing both the information the businesses would want to give and users would want to know. I chose to use cards so the user could quickly see from an image what the activity was and could chose to read more. 

Contact

As I do not have the ability to create a Java Script form I chose to give information on how I could be contacted and answer user queries. 

Mobile View

I wanted the website to display well on mobile devices and be easy to navigate. I enhanced the contrasting colours to draw the attention even quicker. The project was built with mobile first in mind. 

## User Stories

## Features

**Home Page**

The home page consists of the company logo within a navbar containing links to the other pages on the sites and a dropdown menu linking to particular sections of the activities page. It has a header leading into a call to action button that takes the user to a section of the activities page. It also has a short description of the website purpose before displaying a footer containing the socials - facebook, twitter, instagram and pinterest. 

**About**

The about page also contains the same logo, navbar, header and footer. It also contains four images showing the hopeful result of how users will feel if they go through with an activity on the website. The pictures compliment two sections describing the people who wanted the website and how the user can get involved if they want. 

 **Activities** 

The logo, navbar, header and footer is repeated again on the activities page. It is followed by three cards per row on three rows showing a picture of the activity offered, the locations it can be done, who it would suit and a short introduction of what it is.  Lastly it has a call to action button that links to the contact page. 

**Contact**

The contact page details an email address, physical address and phone number whilst also keeping the same logo, navbar, header and footer.
  




  



## Features Left to Implement

I would like to add a contact and booking form to the website once I have more knowledge to do so. 

I would also like to add a section where businesses can get in touch and submit their activity. 

I would have the card on the activity page to link to external websites for the activities it is describing after giving you the option to select where and what type of person it would be for (ie. family, couple, family or group)

## **Bugs**

> Some bugs noticed with the socials in the footer towards the end of
> development. The last icon was wrapping below the first three icons on mobile.
> 
> I also had an issue with the footer where the content at the bottom of the page would go behind the footer. There are certain parts of the footer that remain unfixed due to time constraints. The content does not now go behind but the footer is displaying below the bottom of the viewport in some instances.
