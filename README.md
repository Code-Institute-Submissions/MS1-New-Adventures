## **Bugs**

> Some bugs noticed with the socials in the footer towards the end of
> development. The last icon was wrapping below the first three icons on
> mobile. I have resolved this issue so all 4 footer socials wrap on
> same line.

To deploy the project I followed these steps:

 - From within the main Repo
   [Here](https://github.com/TheBigBushman/emily7-MS1) I clicked on the
   settings button on the right hand side.
 - I then Scrolled down to Github Pages and selected master branch as a
   source.
